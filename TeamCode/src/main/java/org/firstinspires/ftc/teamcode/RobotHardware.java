/*
 *This file defines a Java class that performs the configuration and setup for our robot's
 *  hardware (motors and sensors).
 * It assumes 5 motors (left_front_drive, left_back_drive, right_front_drive, right_back_drive, and arm) and
 * 2 servos (intake and wrist)
 *
 * This one class can be used by ALL of our OpMode without having to cut and paste the code each time.
 *
 * Where possible, the actual hardware objects are "abstracted" (or hidden) so the OpMode code just makes calls
 * into the class, rather than accessing the internet hardware directly. This is why the objects are declared "private".

    /* This constant is the number of encoder ticks for each degree of rotation of the arm.
   To find this, we first need to consider the total gear reduction powering our arm.
   First, we have an external 20t:100t (5:1) reduction created by two spur gears.
   But we also have an internal gear reduction in our motor.
   The motor we use for this arm is a 60RPM Yellow Jacket. Which has an internal gear
   reduction of ~99.5:1. (more precisely it is 13904/261:1)
   We can multiply these two ratios together to get our final reduction.
   The motor's encoder counts 28 times per rotation. So in total you should see about 7458.08
   counts per rotation of the arm. We divide that by 360 to get the counts per degree. */

    These are relative to where the arm was located when you start the OpMode. So make sure the
    arm is reset to collapsed inside the robot before you start the program.

    In these variables you'll see a number in degrees, multiplied by the ticks per degree of the arm.
    This results in the number of encoder ticks the arm needs to move in order to achieve the ideal
    set position of the arm. For example, the ARM_SCORE_SAMPLE_IN_LOW is set to
    160 * ARM_TICKS_PER_DEGREE. This asks the arm to move 160Â° from the starting position.
