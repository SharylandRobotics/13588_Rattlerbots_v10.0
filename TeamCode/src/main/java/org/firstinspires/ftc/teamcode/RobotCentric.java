/*
*this OpMode Illustrates how to use an external "hardware" class to modularize all the robot's sensors and actuators.
* This approach is very efficient because the same hardware class can be used by all of your teleOp and autonomous OpModes
* without requiring many copy & paste operations. Once you have defined and tested the hardware class with one OpMode,
* It is instantly available to other OpMOdes.
*
* The real benefit of this approach is that as you tweak your robot hardware, you only need to make changes in ONE place
* (the Hardware class). So, to be effective you should put as much or your hardware setup and access code as possible in
* the hardware class.
*
* The Hardware class is created in a separate file, and then an "instance" of this class is created in each OpMode.
* In order for the class to do typical OpMode things (like send telemetry data) It must be passed a reference to the
* OpMode object when it's created, so it can access all core OpMode functions.

            Encoders report when the motor has moved a specified angle. They send out pulses which
            only occur at specific intervals (see our ARM_TICKS_PER_DEGREE). This means that the
            position our arm is currently at can be expressed as a whole number of encoder "ticks".
            The encoder will never report a partial number of ticks. So we can store the position in
            an integer (or int).
            A lot of the variables we use in FTC are doubles. These can capture fractions of whole
            numbers. Which is great when we want our arm to move to 122.5°, or we want to set our
            servo power to 0.5.

            setTargetPosition is expecting a number of encoder ticks to drive to. Since encoder
            ticks are always whole numbers, it expects an int. But we want to think about our
            arm position in degrees. And we'd like to be able to set it to fractions of a degree.
            So we make our arm positions Doubles. This allows us to precisely multiply together
            armPosition and our armPositionFudgeFactor. But once we're done multiplying these
            variables. We can decide which exact encoder tick we want our motor to go to. We do
            this by "typecasting" our double, into an int. This takes our fractional double and
            rounds it to the nearest whole number.
